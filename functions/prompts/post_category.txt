I'm going to give you a post from an online forum. I want you to tell me which of the following categories it falls into:

"fact": Expresses a fact that is probably true. It should not include personal opinion, but can include statements about the opinions of others.
"unverified fact": Presents something as fact that is most likely not true.
"experience": Describes the writers own personal experience.
"proposal": Makes a concrete proposal about something that should be done.
"opinion": Expresses the author's own personal opinion.
"other": Does not fall into one of these categories.

If multiple categories seem to apply, choose the category that seems the best fit.

I want you to give a brief reasoning for your decision, and then end with a single line in JSON format referring to one of the categories above, such as {judgement: "opinion"} if you categorized the post as an opinion.

Here is the post:
"{{text}}"

Remember to end your response with a single line in JSON format, such as {judgement: 'fact'}.
