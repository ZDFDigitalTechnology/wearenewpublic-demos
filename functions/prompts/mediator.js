I'm going to give you a list of messages that are part of a conversation. If the most recent message seemed to be angry, or disrespecting other conversation participants, then then reply with the message a skilled mediator might write to help the different sides understand each other.

Write your response in JSON format. Either say {"actionNeeded": false} if no action needed, or respond with {"actionNeeded": true, messageText: [text goes here]} if a mediator message is needed.
