I'm going to give you a post from an online forum that is discussing a topic that people disagree about. I want you to tell me which of these categories it falls into:

1: Strongly {{sideOne}} without any reservations or nuances
2: {{sideOne}}, but with reservations or nuances
3: Expresses sympathy for both sides and doesn't strongly pick one.
4: {{sideTwo}}, but with reservations or nuances
5: Strongly {{sideTwo}}, without any reservations or nuances

I want you to think carefully step by step, and then give your answer as a JSON object referring to one of the numbers above. E.g.
{judegement: 1} - if the post was strongly {{sideOne}}.

Here is the message:

{{text}}
