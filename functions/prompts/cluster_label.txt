I'm going to give you a JSON object representing a list of clusters of messages from a slack channel. I want you to give me a short label for each of these clusters, such that the names are clearly distinct, and reasonably describe each of the messages in the cluster. E.g. "scheduling", "welcoming people", "sharing information". 

Please give your result as a JSON list of strings in the same order as the clusters. E.g. ["Scheduling", "Welcoming People"].

{{{clusters}}}
