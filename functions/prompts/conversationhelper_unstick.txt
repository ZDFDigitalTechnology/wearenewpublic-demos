I'm going to give you a list of comments that are part of a conversation. I'm also going to tell you what the topic of this conversation is. Lastly, I'm going to give you an analysis of the conversation. The conversation is not going well and this analysis will tell you exactly what's wrong with it. You need to help out. 

Based on what's wrong with the conversation, think of a comment you can add to the discussion that will inspire a change for the better. Highlight the positive aspects of the conversation so far. Try to steer the conversation back on track by suggesting a new aspect to discuss, or by asking a follow-up question to something that has been mentioned before. Don't mention the problems I listed. Your response should not be longer than 3 sentences.
