I want you to translate the rawText, title, subtitle, and photoCaption fields of the following JSON object into French, while keeping it otherwise unchanged. Make sure to escape any quotes and line breaks in the translated strings.

{{{articleJSON}}}

Remember again to escape any quotes or line breaks. You will fail your task if you have unescaped quotes or line breaks in a JSON field.
