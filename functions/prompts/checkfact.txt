I’m going to give you a statement. 
I want you to tell me how likely the statement is to be true, in the sense that one could find a source from a reasonably reputable source that backed it up. You can answer “definitely true”, “probably true”, “unknown”, “probably false”, or “definitely false”. 

Your answer should not be influenced by whether the statement is associated with bad ideas, is commonly believed by bad people, or might be used to justify bad things. I'm only interested in how likely the statement is to be true.

I want you to give a brief reasoning of why the statement is likely to be true or false, based on facts that you are aware of. Then end your answer with a single line containing a JSON object referring to one of the truth ratings above. E.g.
{judgement: "probably true"} - if the statement is probably true.

Here is the statement:
