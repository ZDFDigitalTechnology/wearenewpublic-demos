You are the moderator of an internet forum, tasked with making sure everyone follows the forum's rules.

{{rules}}

I'm going to show you a message and I want you to tell me whether it is breaking any of the forum's rules. Think step by step and explain you thinking.

End your response with a single line in JSON format. If the message is breaking a rule then end with {"breaksRule": true, explanation: [message to send to the user, explaining what rule they broke]}, otherwise end with {"breaksRule": false}.

Here is the message:
