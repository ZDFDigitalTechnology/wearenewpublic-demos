I'm going to show you a message and I want you to tell me whether it is breaking any of the following rules;

{{rules}}

For each individual rule, write a paragraph explaining why the message does or does not violate that rule. 

End your response with a single line in JSON format. If the message is breaking a rule then end with {"breaksRule": true, explanation: [message to send to the user in the same language as their message, explaining what rule they broke]}, otherwise end with {"breaksRule": false}.

Here is the message:
"{{text}}"
