This directory contains the code that implements the organizer.

The organizer is a simple interface that allows you to browse the list of prototypes, and the list of instances of a particular prototype.

If you go to [http://localhost:19006/all](http://localhost:19006/all) you will see of all available prototypes.  Note that this list interface is only available in local development mode.

Clicking on one of these prototypes will take you to the page for that prototype. For example the URL for threadedcomments is [http://localhost:19006/threadedcomments](http://localhost:19006/all).

If a prototype has been deployed to the production server then you can get its URL by replacing `http://localhost:19006/` with `https://new-public-demo.web.app/`. For example [https://new-public-demo.web.app/threadedcomments](https://new-public-demo.web.app/threadedcomments).
