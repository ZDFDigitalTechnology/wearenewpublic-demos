This directory contains code that will execute on the client, as part of a React app.

To be more specific, we use the React Native Web version of React, which is able to generate code that can run as a mobile app as well as as a web site. The reason for chosing react native web is to allow easier re-use of code in high quality mobile apps.

Client code will sometimes call APIs on the back end, which you can find in the [functions](../functions/README.md) directory.
