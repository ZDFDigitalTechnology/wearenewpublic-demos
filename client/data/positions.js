export const medicamentShortageTopic = `Germany is facing shortages of vital medications. Antibiotics, which sick people and especially children depend on, are in short supply in hospitals and pharmacies.

#Medications #ZDF #TheTrail

How could this happen? Reporters Johannes Musial and Marius Penzel investigate this question. They follow the trail of the antibiotic shortage from German hospitals to major pharmaceutical companies and all the way to India, where many of our medications are manufactured.
At the children's ward of the Klinikum Stuttgart, the reporters learn that doctors often cannot provide the best possible treatment due to shortages. This is primarily a problem for "the particularly vulnerable, namely children in intensive care units, those with cancer, premature infants," says Friedrich Reichert, head of the pediatric emergency department.

During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, medications were often scarce. Production was partly halted, and supply chains were disrupted. The reporters analyze databases and supply chains. They discover that for the past ten years, more and more medications have been in short supply. This year also faces a shortage: by the end of September 2023, there were shortages of 502 medications, including 107 antibiotics.

The consequences of Europe's dependence on medication production in Asia are evident in a journey to Hyderabad. In India, medications are now manufactured for the whole world: 20 percent of all generics, i.e., medications without patent protection. Residents of a village on the outskirts of Hyderabad talk about contaminated water, unfiltered air, and the serious illnesses caused by them. So, our clean medications are produced under dirty conditions.

Can we succeed in becoming independent from manufacturers in Asia and bringing the production of essential medications back to Europe? And what solutions do the German government and the European Union have for this problem?`

#StoryOfMyLife #37Degrees #ZDF

Katja, married and with a son, finds herself in a marriage with increasing conflicts and communication issues, leading her to ponder: Should she separate or stay? Similarly, Juliane is grappling with this question. Her partner desires a child together, but Juliane already has a child from a previous relationship and, for health reasons, does not want another. Meanwhile, Mira contemplates whether she should salvage a friendship or let go. Ending relationships is challenging for her, and she often puts her needs aside. Celine, on the other hand, has taken the difficult step of cutting ties with her mother. Unable to help her mother, who struggles with alcoholism, Celine had to make the painful decision to break contact.

All of them are confronted with the experiences and stories of others in similar situations, prompting them to reconsider their own choices. How will they ultimately decide?`

export const cancelcultureTopic =`Sarah Bosetti wants to talk... about speech bans and cancel culture. Gottschalk is leaving because he can't talk on TV like at home anymore, and Sarah Bosetti finds this a good reason to talk about speech bans and cancel culture.

Recording from 29.11.2023

"Bosetti wants to talk!" is satire that is more than just entertainment. Every Wednesday, Sarah Bosetti dismantles, dusts off, polishes, and reassembles the current societal debate.

The topic of speech bans and cancel culture is particularly relevant in today's digital age, where social media platforms amplify voices and opinions, sometimes leading to censorship or the silencing of dissenting views. Speech bans refer to restrictions or prohibitions placed on certain forms of expression, often due to societal norms, political correctness, or the fear of backlash. Cancel culture, on the other hand, involves the collective ostracism or boycott of individuals or entities deemed to have acted inappropriately or held objectionable views.

In discussing these topics, Sarah Bosetti likely explores the nuances of free speech, the power dynamics at play in public discourse, and the consequences of online shaming and mob mentality. Satire provides a lens through which to critique and challenge prevailing narratives, offering both humor and insight into complex social issues. Bosetti's commentary serves to provoke thought and encourage viewers to question the societal norms and values that shape our interactions and conversations.`;
