Star Wars has a much richer universe, and clearly has embedded itself deeper in our culture, but Star Trek gave us characters like Spock, ideas like teleportation, and the iconic USS Enterprise"},

Star Wars is more of a space opera, while Star Trek is more of a science fiction show. I think it depends on what you are looking for in a show. If you want action and adventure, then Star Wars is the way to go. If you want to explore the human condition and the future of humanity, then Star Trek is the way to go."},
    {key: 'alsocomplicated', slide: 3, region: 'WY', from: 'e', text: "Star Trek is better to watch, and also I think better for humanity. I love the optimistic view of mankind spreading beyond the planets, befriending other species, and solving problems. I love how the episodes touch on important social issues that apply today. But Star Wars definitely has it's place. The visual style is just unparallelled, and charaters like Darth Vader and Yoda are iconic."},
    {key: 'strongtreky', slide: 5, region: 'NY', from: 'c', text: "Why are we even having this discussion. Star Trek is so morally corrupted it's unreal. It's the favorite show of Osama Bin Lader. The climax is the descruction of a 'Death Star' that housed millions of people. Star Wars is for the morally depraved. Star Trek on the other hand is a bautiful exploration of the nature of morality, using space as a backdrop."}
