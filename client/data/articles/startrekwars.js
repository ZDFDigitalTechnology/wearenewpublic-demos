    rawText: `SAN FRANCISCO, CA â€” What should have been a celebration of two of the most beloved franchises in cinematic and television history turned into chaos when fans of "Star Trek" and "Star Wars" clashed at the Moscone Convention Center over the weekend.

    The conventions for both fan bases were scheduled on the same weekend, albeit in different halls of the center. Tensions began simmering early Saturday when a group of "Star Wars" fans, lightsabers in hand, purportedly began chanting "The Force is with us, always" near the entrance of the "Star Trek" convention. In response, a group of Trekkies allegedly retorted with, "Live long and prosper... without Star Wars."
    
    While the initial exchanges were limited to playful banter, things took a dark turn by mid-afternoon. Witnesses report a disagreement between a fan dressed as Captain Kirk and another as Darth Vader in one of the shared refreshment areas. What started as a verbal disagreement over which franchise had the superior lore and legacy escalated when a thrown pretzel sparked a brawl between the two groups.
    
    Several fans from both sides jumped into the fray, with reports of thrown props, torn costumes, and even the use of plastic lightsabers as weapons. One individual, wearing a Chewbacca costume, reported having his mask torn off, while another, adorned in the Starfleet uniform, said his tricorder was damaged.
    
    Security was called to the scene, but given the size and intensity of the crowd, local police had to be summoned to restore order. Several attendees suffered minor injuries, and authorities reported that seven individuals were detained, though it is unclear if charges will be pressed.
    
    Both conventions had been highly anticipated, with special panels, exclusive merchandise, and celebrity appearances lined up. The incidents have cast a shadow over the events, with many fans expressing their disappointment.
    
    Linda Harris, a dedicated "Star Trek" enthusiast, expressed her dismay, "We're all here to celebrate the stories and characters we love. This is not what Gene Roddenberry would have wanted." Meanwhile, Jackson Torres, a lifelong "Star Wars" devotee, lamented, "It's embarrassing. We're not Sith Lords and Rebels; we're fans. We should remember that."
    
    The organizers of both events released a joint statement late Saturday, condemning the violence and urging attendees to remember the shared values of unity, imagination, and respect present in both franchises. "Star Trek and Star Wars have inspired generations. They've taught us about hope, discovery, and the battles between good and evil. It is our hope that fans can channel these lessons into peaceful coexistence."
    
    The Moscone Convention Center management has also released a statement, expressing regret over the incident and promising a review of their event scheduling processes to avoid such overlaps in the future.
    
    Many on social media have called for unity, with hashtags like #TrekWarsPeace and #GalacticUnity trending.
    
    The conventions will continue as planned, though with heightened security and designated zones to separate the two fan bases. Attendees are urged to remain peaceful and respectful, remembering that in the vast universe of fandom, there's enough space for everyone.
